An extension of [Atom Material UI](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui), which is a syntax theme aiming to provide syntax highlighting based on Googles Material themes. Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

Added support for markdown and markup inspired by [Atom Pubster Syntax](https://github.com/plttn/pubster-syntax).
