A syntax theme that is forked from [Atom Material UI](https://github.com/silvestreh/atom-material-ui). Inspired by Mattia Astorino's [SublimeText theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

Added support for markdown and markup inspired by [Atom Pubster Syntax](https://github.com/plttn/pubster-syntax).
